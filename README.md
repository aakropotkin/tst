# TST Take Home

The following project contains solutions and unit tests to two
"take home problems".

In each of the child subdirs you may run `sbt test` to unit test the problem,
or `sbt` followed by `~run` to run the test provided in the assignments.

Output ordering and formatting differs slightly from the assignment but is
effectively the same.
